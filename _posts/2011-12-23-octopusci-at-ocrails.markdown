Recently I a gave a presentation at an OC Rails meetup in Santa Ana about the offical release
of Octopusci. In the presentation I explain exactly what Octopusci is, why I felt the need to
build, and provide a little insight into where I would like to take it.

I have provided the audio recording of the presentation synced to the slides below. I hope you
find it useful. The presentation is roughly 18 mins long so if you have some time check it out.
There is a little background noise in the recording but it isn't too bad. Hopefully, with the
next presentation I can get a better audio recording. For those of you that don't like watching
videos I have also provided a PDF of the slides [here](/files/official_release_presentation.pdf).
