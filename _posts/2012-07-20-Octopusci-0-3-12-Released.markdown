I just released OctopusCI 0.3.12. This release includes some license changes and as well as one of the most wanted feature requests out. What you may be wonder is that. Well, it is the re-enqueue feature. This feature now allows you simply to click the *re-enqueue* link next to the job id to force it to rebuild a specific job.
