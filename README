The purpose of this project is provide a simple CI server that will work with
GitHub Post-Receive hook. It is also specifically designed to handle multiple
build/job queues for each branch.

This would basically allow you to every time code is pushed to the central
repository enqueue a build/job for the specific branch. That way if you
have topic branches that are being pushed to the central repository along
side the mainline branch they will get queue properly as well.

My idea for implementation at this point is that if I can detect the branch
from the GitHub Post-Receive hook then I can identify branch. If I can
identify branch then I can maintain individual queues for each branch.

Then the execution would look at config values for predefined branches and
priorities for order of running them so that the mainline branch running its
jobs could take precedence over non specified topic branches.
